        <p>There are two types of flexboxes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Flex containers: Groups a bunch of flex items together and defines how they're positioned.</li>
            <li>Flex items: Every HTML element that's a direct child of a flex container is an item. Can be manipulated indivudally, but for the most part it's up to the container to determine their layout. Main purpose is to let the container know how many things are to be positioned.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Important to remember that flex containers only know how to position elements that are one level deep (their direct children). </p>
        <p>The key to flexboxes (look at my CSS and HTML) is to nest everything intelligently.</p>
        <p>Something fun you can do with flexboxes that you cannot do with normal floats is control the vertical alignment.</p>
        <p>Finally we can get to the eponymous nature of our flexboxes or flexible boxes. They can shrink and stretch to match the width of their containers. We can do this with the <strong>flex</strong> CSS property. It allows for flex items to have flexible widths. It works as a weight telling the flex container how to distribute extra space to each item. An item with a flex value for 2 will grow twice as fast as items with the default of 1.</p>
