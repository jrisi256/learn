        <!-- Before responsive design during the beginning of the mobile web, mobile devices would simply zoom out to display the entire website. Then users could zoom in when appropriate to do whatever it is they wanted to do. This default behavior prevents mobile devices from rendering the mobile parts of our layout. So the above line prevents the default behavior from taking place.-->

    <!--
    
    Responsive design refers to the idea that your website should display equally well regardless of the screen being used to view it.
        
    This is achieved using something called "media queries". They are a way of conditionally applying CSS rules. They tell the browser to ignore or apply certain rules depending on the user's device.
    
    Media queries allow us to present the same HTML content as distinct CSS layouts. So we only need ot maintain set of HTML files.s

Someone could have a retina display on a smartphone for example in which case they'll want the standard resolution photo. So in our srcset, we set 2000w and 1000w (instead of 1x and 2x) which says display high-res photo is 2000 pixels wide and normal photo is 1000 pixels wide. -->

                <!-- Now we also use the sizes attribute which sets up a series of media queries. We're telling the browser that the image will fill the browser window up to 960px wide, after which it will always appear as 960px wide. 100vw means the image's width will be 100% of the viewport width. -->
