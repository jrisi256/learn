        <p> The CSS box model treats every HTML element as a box with a bunch of properties which determine where it appears on the page.</p>

        <p>Some important rules about boxes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Block boxes appear below the previous block element.</li>
            <li>Width of block boxes is set based on the width of its parent container (in this case the width of the browser window).</li>
            <li>The default height of block boxes depends on the content it contains.</li>
            <li>Inline boxes don't affect the vertical spacing of the page. They can have a height (through padding), but it will not cause other elements to shift.</li>
            <li>The width of inline boxes is based on the content it contains, not the width of the parent of the parent element.</li>
        </ul>

        <img src = "css_box_model.png" alt = "CSS box model" width = 600/>

        <p>Of course we can change these defaults by using the CSS property "display". Which we can do to change our inline elements to block boxes rather than inline boxes. However it is commented out in the CSS.</p>

        <p>Differences between padding and margin:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Padding has a background while margins are always transparent.</li>
            <li>Padding is included in the click area of an element. Margins are not.</li>
            <li>Margins collapse vertically. Padding does not.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> As noted above, inline boxes don't really have a height. Therefore changing the margin on them only affects the horizontal spacing. However the padding can have a height.</p>

        <p> A quirk of the box model is veritcal margin collapse. When you have two boxes with vertical margins sitting next to each other they will collapse (instead of being added to each other). Only the biggest one is displayed. This behavior comes in handy when defining the minimum space between elements.</p>

        <p> However sometimes you want to prevent this behavior. To do that, you need to put an invisible element between them. In this case we are using the div element. This forces the top margin and bottom margin to activate.</p>

        <p>Quick reminder that padding never collapses. So if you can use it, maybe use it?</p>

        <p>Finally a third option is to stick with bottom-only or top-only margin conventions.</p>

        <p> Now you may be asking: what is div? Well div (and span which we'll now introduce) are container elements because sometimes you just need a generic box to style your web page. They don't provide any semantic meaning like HTML normally does. They provide a hook for adding CSS styles to arbitrary sections of a web page e.g. preventing margin collapse or grouping the first few paragraphs together so as to give them different formatting.</p>

        <p> Now what's the difference between div and span? div is meant for block-level content and span is meant for inline content.</p>

        <p> Below are some pictures detailing how setting the width of boxes works using CSS. It's explained the box-styles.css file in the comments, too. </p>

        <img src = "box_sizing_content_box.png" alt = "Sizing boxes with content box" width = 450/>
        <img src = "box_sizing_border_box.png" alt = "Sizing boxes with border box" width = 450/>

        <h1> Headings are block elements </h1>

        <p> Paragraphs are blocks too. <em>However</em> &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; elements are not. They are <strong>inline</strong> elements.</p>

        <div style = "padding-top: 1px"></div>

        <p>Block elements define the flow of the HTML document while inline elements do not.</p>
