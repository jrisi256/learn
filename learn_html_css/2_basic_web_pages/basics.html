<!--The DOCTYPE tells browsers it's an HTML web page.
Then our entire web page needs to be wrapped in an <html> tag.
<head> tag contains all the page metadata like the page style, any CSS, and anything else necessary for the page but not necessary for the user to see.
<body> corresponds to the visible portion of the page-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Learning HTML</title> <!-- Tab name -->
    </head>
        <h1>Our first heading. Can make smaller headings using h2, h3, etc. all the way to h6.</h1>

        <h4>Here's h4 for comparison.</h4>

        <p>This is a paragraph or "p" element.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>This is the first element of an unordered list which is built using the "ul" tag.</li>
            <li>You can add more items by adding more "li" tags nested within the "ul" tag.</li>
            <li><p>If you want, you can add other elements, like this paragraph for example, to your list. But always make sure it's wrapped in a "li" tag.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>In contrast to unordered lists, we can also build unordered lists.</li>
            <li>They're built using the "ol" tag.</li>
            <li>However we still use "li" elements to fill them up.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Inline elements</h2>

        <p>We have have been using block-level elements up until now. Block-level elements are always drawn on a new line. In contrast, <em>inline elements like this "em" tag</em> affect sections of text within the line.</p>

        <p>There is also the <strong>"strong"</strong> tag.</p>

        <p>Last but not least we can emphasize and strengthen something by using <strong><em>both the "strong" and "em" tags (in any order so long as they're closed properly)</em></strong></p>

        <!--Why say strengthen and emphasize versus bold and italicize? Well strong and em are supposed to provide semantic information about our text. CSS handles the presentation and decides whether something is bold or italicized.-->

        <h2>Empty elements</h2>

        <p>HTML condenses consecutive spaces into a single space when rendering in the browser. To manually insert different kinds of space, we use "empty" or "self-closing" elements.</p>

        <p>For example <br/> here is a line break.</p>

        <!--Of course remember the line break should only be used to convey semantic information. It shouldn't be used for presentation purposes.-->

        <p>Another kind of self-closing element is the horizontal rule.</p>
