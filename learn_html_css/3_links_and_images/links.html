        <h1>Links</h1>

        <p>Links are created using the "a" element which stands for anchor, and they look <a href = "images.html" target = "_blank">like this.</a></p>

        <!--What we did above is we used the href attribute of the "a" element to tell the link where to go when it is clicked. The target attribute says what to do when the link is clicked. In this case, the "_blank" option means to open the link in a new window.-->

        <p>This page is about links! There are three types of links:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Absolute links like <a href = 'https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'>this one</a> which links to the Mozilla Developer Network. Absolute links are the most detailed way to refer to a web resource. Typically they should be used only to refer to outside sources because hardcoding the path of all your own resources can lead to problems.</li>
            <li>Relative links like a link to <a href = 'misc/extras.html'>our own web page</a>. Relative links are "relative" to the file currently being edited. They're nice but can get confusing.</li>
            <li>Finally there are root-relative links which instead of being relative to the current page are relative to the root of the website. They won't work here, but they'd work on a web server. The most useful type of link. It would hypothetically look something <a href = "/">like this</a>.</li>
        </ul>
