        <h2>HTML Entities</h2>

        <p>There are three reserved characters in HTML: &lt;, &gt;, and &amp;. Specifcally we invoke them using "HTML entities" which are invoked using an ampersand followed by the code and then ending with a semicolon. They're also useful for adding symbols not found on your keyboard like &AElig;. There are a lot of entities which can be found <a href = "https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref" target = "_blank">here</a>.</p>
