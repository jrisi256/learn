## Introduction

I thought the introduction was quite good.

We begin with a poem by Schiller lamenting the passing of the old gods and how at some point in time *mythos* became replaced with *logos*. Broadly speaking, our emotional and intuitive sides have ceded their status to our rational and logical faculties. And perhaps the point of time when this happened (for the Western world) might be the time of the Presocratics who are our intellectual forefathers in establishing philosophy and science.

Very few fragments of the original Presocratics' works survive. We must rely on the doxographic tradition as well as Aristotle and other commentators unreliable transcription to make sense of them.

What do we mean when we say the Presocratics were the first to practice science? By one definition of science (a process through which knowledge is obtained by engaging in empirical observation, creating testable hypotheses, and refining these hypotheses through further observation and experimentation until one can predict and explain the phenomenon in question), the Presocratics were not scientists. They did not experiment all that much. Their hypotheses were hardly testable, and when observation clashed with their theories, they tended to prefer their theories.

The author instead feels more comfortable categorizing the Presocratics as proto-scientists who held certain scientific attitudes:

1. The world is comprehensible.
2. The rational human mind is the correct tool for understanding the world.
3. Curiosity tempered by restraint and guided by the evidence.
4. "A love of and a facility with abstract concepts".
5. An approach to problem solving wherein problems are broken down into their component parts and dealt with separately.

Not all Presocratics held all these attitudes, but enough of them held enough of these attitudes.

Were the Presocratics really the first to hold these attitudes? (brief aside about how history tends to make clean breaks to demarcate movements when such clean breaks never actually exist). Mythos thinking is shot through with seeing every aspect of the world as divine and behaving according to the whims of (usually) some anthropomorphized deities/spirits/divine beings. Of course mythos based societies still think systematically about certain things, but their ideas of cause/effect and the nature of reality are fundamentally different from logos thinking.

Quote (xxiii), "It is not that I, an individual, am feeling awe of my own accord: it is a deity of some kind out there who is making me feel it. Then along came the Presocratics and said, 'No there is an order in the world. And it is precisely because it is ordered that it can be comprehended by the rational human mind.'" It's **very** important to note what makes the Presocratics the first alleged philosophers and scientists in the Western world is NOT that they were the first to use experimental empirical observation and logical, rational argumentation. It was that they were the first to (sort of) use these approaches while holding the above mentioned scientific attitudes.

The first heirs to the Presocratics were the Sophists. As literacy and education spread across the Greek world, their spread created an intellectual class who were trained in the use of *reason*. Sophists took the anthropocentrism of the Presocratics and ran with it. Coupled with ascendant Greek supremacy (defeating the Persians) and technological progress, humans were seen as masters of their destiny not Gods. Furthermore, the rise of the Athenian empire and (limited) democracy within the Athenian empire meant rhetoric became a valuable and powerful tool. The creation of a wealthy, elite class in Athenian society who valued rhetoric and wanted a more expansive education suited to their needs meant Presocratics were in high demand.

To end, what is a myth? According to the author, a myth is a traditional tale which helps to explain and form consensus around what is reality for a given community and to help make an individual's experience of that reality meaningful. So while myths explain reality, not all attempts to explain reality are myths. However we can (and should consider) science the new mythological framework for explaining and forming consensus around what is reality and how we all fit into it. Logos and mythos are bound together and swirl around each other and are echoes of the dual impulses of humanity which we see reflected in the Presocratics who were just as beholden to mysticism as their forerunners were.

Quote (xxxiii), "The gods, in some disguise or other, never die."

## The Milesians: Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes

Miletus was an old, somewhat wealthy trading city with a mix of cultures and different ideas which is why perhaps philosophy sprung forth from here.

### Anaximander

The world originated from *apeiron* or "the boundless", an infinite mass of unspecified material. Cannot be generated or destroyed simply is and serves as the origin of all else so when things are created/destroyed they are taking from or returning to the infinite source. Somehow opposites formed in the boundless causing them to separate from the boundless thus creating the world. These opposites were held in equilibrium by cosmic necessity (not by divine whim). Explains origins of the world/weather/life as byproducts of cosmic rules.

### Anaximenes

The underlying nature of things is air rather than the boundless. Air when dispersed or condensed forms different substances which in turn give rise to all the substances in the world. Interesting use of analogical reasoning wherein human breath can be made hot/cold which is then applied via some form of logical argumentation that thus the same principle would apply for the natural laws.

## Xenophanes

Rejects anthropomorphic "Homeric" religion. Famous quote about horses having horse gods. God is a sort of being which exists throughout (around?) the universe. Extending his argument, we cannot come to know "God" or "gods" because it/they are so beyond the reach of human intelligence. Contrast to human knowledge which is limited by our experience. As such we are limited to belief rather than true knowledge. Through diligent research(?) we can improve our situation and make progress.

## Heraclitus

There is the truth (logos) which speaks to those who are prepared to listen but most people are asleep to it. Interestingly he says this truth exists separate from him and his account of it. We can only gain a human comprehension of it rather than a divine understanding because we are limited by our senses. Nevertheless we can persist. The truth is that all is one which is in harmony. How can everything be one and harmonious when everything around us is constantly changing (the same man never steps in the same river)? This is us asleep using our senses naively rather than awakening to the truth. The unity is described using the tension which results from pulling the bow string. Two opposite forces pulling against each other but proportionally thus creating balance. One would not exist without the other thus everything is connected and one.

## Parmenides

Two ways of thinking about the world: *that which is* and *that which is not*. And the former is the only one which is informative. The latter is nothing. The former means a few different things:

* All that which exists.
* An item is something (we can attribute characteristics to it).

Thinking and being are not identical (we can imagine things which don't exist) but they are connected. For example, we can only think of things which are (i.e. which have properties). Something without any properties is nothing and thus we cannot talk about it and thus it's uninformative.

So when we talk *that which is*, we're talking about this unchanging eternal singular blob. He starts with this premise and gradually works up to this conclusion. Fragment 8 (pg. 59 - 61) very important here.

* Creation cannot take place from *that which is not* (things which exist cannot come from *that which does not exist* because *that which does not exist* has nothing which we could attribute to it that would allow it to birth something).
* But creation cannot take place from *that which is* either (*that which is* cannot become or change into anything other than *that which is*).
* So therefore *that which is* simply has existed.
* Since *that which is* cannot change into anything or become anything other than *that which is*, it was never birthed and thus must have always been. Similarly it will always exist, never changing, and thus never perishing or ceasing to be *that which is* (existing/having attributes).
* There are no such knowable things as creation or destruction and these concepts exist only because we give them explanatory power even though, as Parmenides claims, they have none.
* These are epistemological questions Parmenides is dealing with. Parmenides' methodology and his thinking about *that which is* is the only true way to come to know of the world. The sensory world fools us and distracts us from the *real* world only accessible through reason.
